The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the phonebook of the internet. It helps us find the right number (an IP address) for a given name (a domain such as `www.google.com`). Without DNS, we would need to memorize long, often complex IP addresses for every website we visit. DNS makes our lives easier by allowing us to use human-friendly names to access online resources.

#### Domain Names vs. IP Addresses

|**Address**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Domain Name`|A readable address like `www.example.com` that people can easily remember.|
|`IP Address`|A numerical label (e.g., `93.184.216.34`|

DNS bridges the gap between these two, so we can just type `www.google.com` without needing to remember the underlying IP address.

#### DNS Hierarchy

DNS is organized like a tree, starting from the root and branching out into different layers.

|**Layer**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Root Servers`|The top of the DNS hierarchy.|
|`Top-Level Domains (TLDs)`|Such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, or country codes like `.uk`, `.de`.|
|`Second-Level Domains`|For example, `example` in `example.com`.|
|`Subdomains or Hostname`|For instance, `www` in `www.example.com`, or `accounts` in `accounts.google.com`.|

#### DNS Resolution Process (Domain Translation)

When we enter a domain name in our browser, the computer needs to find the corresponding IP address. This process is known as `DNS resolution` or `domain translation`. The steps below show how this process works.

|**Step**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Step 1`|We type `www.example.com` into our browser.|
|`Step 2`|Our computer checks its local DNS cache (a small storage area) to see if it already knows the IP address.|
|`Step 3`|If not found locally, it queries a `recursive DNS server`. This is often provided by our Internet Service Provider or a third-party DNS service like Google DNS.|
|`Step 4`|The recursive DNS server contacts a `root server`, which points it to the appropriate `TLD name server` (such as the `.com` domains, for instance).|
|`Step 5`|The TLD name server directs the query to the `authoritative name server` for `example.com`.|
|`Step 6`|The authoritative name server responds with the IP address for `www.example.com`.|
|`Step 7`|The recursive server returns this IP address to your computer, which can then connect to the website’s server directly.|

This all happens in just fractions of a second. Below we can see a simple example of the Domain Translation process. Suppose you want to visit the website at `www.example.com`. Without the Domain Name System (DNS), we would need to know and type the IP address, such as `93.184.216.34`, every time you want to access that site. With DNS in place, we can simply type `www.example.com` into our browser. Behind the scenes, DNS automatically finds and translates this domain name into the correct IP address for us, ensuring a seamless connection to the website. The diagram below illustrates the diagram of the `DNS Query Process`.

### DNS Resolution Flow:

1. Recursive Resolver (Recursive DNS Server) → **Root DNS Server**
    
2. Root Server → Points to TLD Server
    
3. TLD Server → Points to Authoritative Server
    
4. Authoritative Server → Returns IP Address
